## Task 1

## Predicting House Prices:
Objective: Build a model to predict house prices
based on various features.

## Description: 
Use a dataset containing information
about houses (e.g., size, number of bedrooms,
location) to create a predictive model that estimates
the price of a house.

## Key Steps:
1 Data cleaning and preprocessing
2 Feature engineering
3 Model selection and training (e.g., linear regression)
4 Model evaluation and fine-tuning
